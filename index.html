			<p style = "text-indent: 50px;"  >Welcome to my personal website! My name is Yvonne Johnson and I am a 3rd year at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" style = "color: black;">The Ohio State University</a> studying <a href="https://www.cse.osu.edu/" style = "color: black;">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. Although I didn't enter college as a Computer Science major I've always had a passion for technology. When I was younger I was fascinated with the internet and would spend hours googling random words that came to my mind and hopping from webpage to webpage. I dreamed of having my own website and checkedout a book from the library to learn more. I learned some HTML and was amazed at seeing my own words come to life on the computer. Although my interest eventually waned it was eventually reawakened when the website I used to help me learned math, Khan Academy, came out with a Computer Science curriculum. I began to teach myself coding and once again fell in love with seeing my own work come alive on my computer screen. My favorite of these projects, which can still be found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kellster6/projects" style = "color: black;">here</a>, was a simple game of pong. </p>
			<p style = "text-indent: 50px;"  >My senior year of high school I took an honors Computer Science class, which I both loved and excelled at. It was my favorite class of my senior year and I found myself trying out extra programming assignments from the textbook. Although I am still not entirely sure why, I was very hesitant to pursue CS as a major but I knew I wanted to do something where I could use math and science, so I entered the college as an undeclared engineering major. In my classes I began to explore the different engineering majors waiting to come upon some undiscovered passion. Although I enjoyed most topics in my introductory engineering class, I enjoyed when we did C/C++ the most. I realized I had actually already discovered something I was truly excited about a long time ago and with that I declared my major. Four semesters and two internships later I'm still learning what parts of computer science I like and learning new things all the time. Although I don't have a strong interest in front-end development I decided to make this website to learn a little bit more about UI and to fufill my childhood dream of having my own website! To see what else I've been up to these days, check out my projects and involvement pages.</p>
